# creative coding sketchbook

A collection of experiments that are periodically uploaded to [instagram](http://instagram.com/natelaffanio) and [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/natelaffanio).  All the XR stuff is uploaded to [creative-coding-sketchbook.web.app](https://creative-coding-sketchbook.web.app/).

Generally speaking, this is an attempt to capture and share the various ways I code creatively. Very much a work in progress, and I apologize for the earlier files - they might not work, as I was just figuring out how all this stuff works.


## Exporting

Export scripts have been moved to `export-scripts/README.md`.

## Notes

Find files to add to lfs using `find . -type f -size +5M ! -path '*/node_modules/*'`
