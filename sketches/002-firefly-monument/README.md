# 002 - Firefly Monument

First shot at shadergraph, visual effects graph, bolt and archimatrix, all rolled in to one.

To use src, start new 2019.4.8.f1 URP project, install 

 - Bolt
 - Archimatix
 - SkyBox1
 - GrassFlowers

And save their top level directories in `Assets > Shared > Downloaded`.

THEN add `firefly-monument.unitypackage`

No guarantees. I'm learning here.
