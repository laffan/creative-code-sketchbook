# Sketches

Once something has taken enough shape in the sandbox world, move it here, package it up, hone.

### Remember

- For **Blender** files, 
  - make sure everything is packed and "compressed" is checked off in file save settings
- For **P5.js** & **R3F** create a self-contained project with a package file.
- For **Unity** build it and upload to itch.io
